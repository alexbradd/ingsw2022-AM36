## Project specification

The project consists of an implementation of a distributed system made of a
single server and multiple clients that can participate in matches between each
other. The server and clients will communicate using sockets and the TCP-IP
protocol. The client will provide both a CLI and GUI interface.

The final project will include:

1. The initial UML diagram;
2. The final UML diagram, generated from the code;
3. Rule conforming implementation of the specifications;
4. Documentations of network protocol used;
5. Peer review documents;
6. Source code of client and server applications;
7. Source code of unit tests;
